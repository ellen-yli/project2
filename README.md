This vignette explains how to contact an API, demonstrated with the
[Spoonacular Food API](https://spoonacular.com/food-api). We will create
functions to interact with the API and return data.

# Example of R-code that can contact Food data API by searching criteria

First, we’ll show an example of how to contact the API using the complex
recipe search:

``` r
res<-GET("https://api.spoonacular.com/recipes/complexSearch?query=chicken&maxFat=60&number=5&apiKey=be3c2a74ce6c4f0c83b254b34ceca7f5")
dat<-fromJSON(res$url)
as.data.frame(dat)
```

    ##   results.id   results.title                                           results.image results.imageType       nutrients
    ## 1     637876      Chicken 65 https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/637876-312x231.jpg               jpg Fat, 2.72924, g

    ## 4     638174 Chicken Lo Mein https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/638174-312x231.jpg               jpg Fat, 7.88814, g
    ## 5     638086 Chicken Fingers https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/638086-312x231.jpg               jpg Fat, 6.29338, g
    ##   offset number totalResults
    ## 1      0      5          577
    ## 2      0      5          577
    ## 3      0      5          577
    ## 4      0      5          577
    ## 5      0      5          577

However, new searches are tedious to type out each time! We will create
functions to interact with the API to retrieve data.

# Package Requirements

Here, we list the packages required to interact with the API and use the
functions defined in this vignette.  
- `httr` - used to access the API  
- `jsonlite` - used to convert the data from the API into a data frame  
- `tidyverse` - used for data manipulation and graphing

# API Interaction Functions

To use some of the interaction functions in this section, you will need
to have a key to access the API. You can register for free
[here](https://spoonacular.com/food-api/console#Dashboard) if you do not
already have a key for this API.

## `recipe.search`

This function allows you to search for recipes given query (i.e., what
are you looking for?), [diet
type](https://spoonacular.com/food-api/docs#Diets), [type of
dish](https://spoonacular.com/food-api/docs#Meal-Types) (such as
breakfast, dessert, side dish, etc.), the maximum number of carbs (in
grams), the minimum amount of protein (in grams), and the maximum amount
of fat (in grams). To give more than one option for a given input, you
will need to give a string of comma separated values.

``` r
recipe.search<- function(key=NULL, query=NULL, diet=NULL, type=NULL, maxCarbs=NULL, minProtein=NULL, maxFat=NULL){
  if(is.null(key)){
    return("your API Key is required.")
  }
  basic.url<-"https://api.spoonacular.com/recipes/complexSearch"
  search.opt<-list(query=query, diet=diet, type=type, maxCarbs=maxCarbs, minProtein=minProtein, maxFat=maxFat, apiKey=key, NULL)
  search.opt2<-search.opt[-which(sapply(search.opt, is.null))]
  #remove spaces from user input
  for(i in 1:length(search.opt2)){
    search.opt2[i]<-str_remove_all(search.opt2[i], " ")
  }
  res<-paste0(basic.url,"?")
  for(i in 1:length(search.opt2)){
    res<-paste0(res,"&", names(search.opt2[i]), "=", search.opt2[i])
  }
  res <- str_remove(res, "&")    #remove the first &, unnecessary

  data<-httr::GET(res)
  mydf<- jsonlite::fromJSON(data$url)
  result<-as.data.frame(mydf)
      return(result)
    }
```

Search recipe example by using the function above:

``` r
recipe.search(key="be3c2a74ce6c4f0c83b254b34ceca7f5", query="chicken", maxFat=60)
```

## `random.recipes`

With this function, you can get between 1 and 100 random recipes. You
may also include tags by giving a string of comma separated values.

``` r
#gives 1-100 random recipes
random.recipes <- function(apiKey=NULL, number=NULL, tags=NULL){
  if(is.null(apiKey)){
    return("Please enter your API key.")
  }
  
  input <- list(apiKey=apiKey, number=number, tags=tags, NULL)   #null list item to use all options
  opts <- input[-which(sapply(input, is.null))]
  #remove spaces from user input
  for(i in 1:length(opts)){
    opts[i]<-str_remove_all(opts[i], " ")
  }
  #cerate URL
  link <- "https://api.spoonacular.com/recipes/random?"
  for(i in 1:length(opts)){
    link<-paste0(link,"&", names(opts[i]), "=", opts[i])
  }
  link <- str_remove(link, "&")    #remove the first &
  
  dat <- httr::GET(link)
  df<- jsonlite::fromJSON(dat$url)
  results <- as.data.frame(df)
  return(results)
}
```

We show an example of this function here.

``` r
random.recipes(apiKey = "31bf40952ec14026b2f82b5055fdab93", number=20, tags = "carrots, potatoes")
```

    ## 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Chop your onions, slice your carrots and smash your garlic. Set aside.\nPeel and chop the potatoes. Set aside in a bowl of cold water.\nRemove the casing from your chorizo. This is an important step. Chorizo casing is tough and unforgiving and will make the sausage link curl during the cooking process. Just remove it and don't worry about appearance. Cut the links length-wise then chop into half-moons. Sautee in a separate pan until the are nice and browned. Don't put into the pot until the last minute, otherwise the color of the chorizo will leach into the soup turning it a weird red color.\nNow it's time to prepare the kale. With each individual leaf, cut out the stem. You can do this several ways. Cut a triangle out of the leaf, or fold over the leaf and cut out the stem that way. Or rip off the halves of the leaves off the stem. I like a little bit of stem to give some crunch and texture.\nTightly roll the leaf into a bundle.\nRun your knife over it to julienne the leaf into thin strips.\nDon't worry if it's not perfect. Set aside the kale.\nIn a big pot, sautee your onions, carrots and garlic in a bit of olive oil.\nOnce the vegetables start to soften, add the potatoes and some crushed red pepper flakes. Stir the pot and cook the potatoes until the outer edges start turning clear.\nThen add the 6 cups of water and 2 bouillion packets (or 4 cups of broth and 2 cups of water) to the pot. Bring to a boil then let simmer until the potatoes are cooked.\nWith a wooden spoon, mash the potatoes against the side of the pot. Do this until almost all the chunks of potatoes are mashed. Leave some chunks behind. This will give your soup a wonderful hearty texture.\nNow it's time to add the Kale. It looks like a lot and will fill up your whole pot but not to worry because it wilts down pretty quickly.\nCook for 5 minutes at a simmer then stir in chorizo sausage. Serve hot or at room temperature (the latter is my favorite). Eat with a nice crusty loaf of Portuguese bread. Enjoy!

The corning of the beef makes the beef salty enough, so no need to add more.\nHeat 1 TBSP oil in a large, shallow oven-safe pot over medium-high heat. Add beef and sear each side for about 3 minutes, just to develop a nice brown crust. This will seal in the beef's juices.\nRemove beef to a plate. Pour guinness into the pot to deglaze. Scrape up any browned bits. Add beef broth, pickling spice, brown sugar, bay leaf, and minced garlic. Bring mixture up to a simmer.\nReturn the beef to the pot with any additional juices that have accumulated on the plate.\nCover the pot and place on the bottom rack in your oven. Bake for 2 1/2 - 3 hours, or until a fork can easily be inserted into the meat.\nBaste the meat with the surrounding juices every 30 minutes or so.\nAfter 2 hours, add carrots, parsnips, and potatoes to the pot. They will only take about 25-30 minutes of simmering to cook.\nRemove pot from the oven. Place beef on a cutting board and let it rest for 15 minutes before carving into thin slices (cut against the grain of the meat). Remove vegetables and arrange them on a serving platter. Cover with foil. Place the pot on the burner and bring sauce to a boil. Add cabbage and cook for about 7 minutes, until it has softened. Place the cabbage on the serving platter with the other vegetables.\nStrain the sauce in the pot and stir in 2 or 3 TBSP of spicy honey mustard until dissolved. Place in a small dish or gravy boat with a ladle and serve alongside the beef.\nAfter slicing the beef and arranging it on the serving platter, ladle the guinness mustard sauce over the top to rehydrate and glaze the beef and vegetables.

Boil them until they're tender. Mash them and let them cool for a while.\nChop the mushrooms, carrot and red bell pepper. Add them into your food processor and pulse until all ingredients are well mixed together.\nHeat oil in a large skillet. Add the mixture above, diced onions, chopped dill and parsley, soy granules, eggs (or egg substitute) and spices. Saut for 10 minutes.\n* I added the soy granules without boiling them because the mushrooms contain a lot of water and these soy granules will absorb all excess water.\nPut some parchment paper on the bottom of a casserole. Divide the mashed potatoes in two. Place the first half in the casserole and spread it with a spatula. Add the filling. Place over the other half of mashed potatoes.\nHeat your oven at 392. Put the casserole in the oven. Cook for 40 minutes.\nDon't serve immediately. Let it cool for at least half an hour.

Pour in the cream of mushroom soup, Dale's seasoning, water, and beef broth and stir until mixed well. Add in your stew meat, potatoes, onions, carrots, celery, and green onions. Stir well until covered and cook on low for 8 hours. You can add salt and pepper as desired, but the flavors and the Dale's marry together so well that you probably won’t need them.</p>

Set aside., Peel and chop the potatoes. Set aside in a bowl of cold water., Remove the casing from your chorizo. This is an important step. Chorizo casing is tough and unforgiving and will make the sausage link curl during the cooking process. Just remove it and don't worry about appearance., Cut the links length-wise then chop into half-moons., Sautee in a separate pan until the are nice and browned. Don't put into the pot until the last minute, otherwise the color of the chorizo will leach into the soup turning it a weird red color., Now it's time to prepare the kale. With each individual leaf, cut out the stem. You can do this several ways., Cut a triangle out of the leaf, or fold over the leaf and cut out the stem that way. Or rip off the halves of the leaves off the stem. I like a little bit of stem to give some crunch and texture., Tightly roll the leaf into a bundle., Run your knife over it to julienne the leaf into thin strips., Don't worry if it's not perfect. Set aside the kale., In a big pot, sautee your onions, carrots and garlic in a bit of olive oil., Once the vegetables start to soften, add the potatoes and some crushed red pepper flakes. Stir the pot and cook the potatoes until the outer edges start turning clear., Then add the 6 cups of water and 2 bouillion packets (or 4 cups of broth and 2 cups of water) to the pot. Bring to a boil then let simmer until the potatoes are cooked., With a wooden spoon, mash the potatoes against the side of the pot. Do this until almost all the chunks of potatoes are mashed. Leave some chunks behind. This will give your soup a wonderful hearty texture., Now it's time to add the Kale. It looks like a lot and will fill up your whole pot but not to worry because it wilts down pretty quickly., Cook for 5 minutes at a simmer then stir in chorizo sausage., Serve hot or at room temperature (the latter is my favorite).

    ## 7  , 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, Preheat an oven to 350Stud the rinsed and peeled rack of corned beef ribs with the three cloves, fairly evenly spaced along the top meaty side of the ribs., Place the ribs in a large, deep covered roasting pan or Dutch oven., Sprinkle the peppercorns on top of the ribs along with the slices of garlic and the bay leaves., Add enough water to just cover the ribs - this will vary depending on the size of your pan., Put the pan, covered, into the oven and cook for one hour.While the ribs are braising for the first hour, prepare the vegetables.After the first hour, add all the vegetables, except for the cabbage, into the pan. Re-cover and return to the oven for 45 minutes.After the 45 minutes, add the cabbage to the pan, re-cover and return to the oven for fifteen minutes.During the final braising of the ribs and vegetables, prepare the glaze., Combine the sugar, beer and vinegar in a small saucepan and heat to a boil over medium heat.Cook at a low boil for 5 minutes, stirring often., Remove the glaze from the heat, add the mustard and stir to combine.Set aside until ribs and vegetables are finished braising., Remove the vegetables and ribs from the oven when the cooking time is complete (about 2 hours)., Remove the ribs and place on a baking rack set over a pan. Re-cover the vegetables to keep them warm while you glaze the ribs., Brush a light coat of glaze on the underside of the ribs and a thicker layer on the top side.  Use about 1/2 the glaze., Place the ribs into the oven and cook for 15 minutes.  This will give you a good base layer of glaze.After 15 minutes, remove the ribs for a final coating and turn the oven up to 425, Brush the rest of the glaze on the ribs, return to the oven and cook for 10 to 15 minutes more, until the glaze is lightly browned and bubbly but not burned.When the glazed ribs are done, allow to cook for a couple of minutes (that sugar will be hot!)., Remove the vegetables from the braising liquid and serve with the ribs on a platter to serve and cut at the table or cut the meat into rib sections. If you wish to forego the vegetables,  by the way, the ribs make a fantastic appetizer all on their own., 13346, 1002011, 23236, corned beef, clove, ribs, corned beef, clove, ribs, corned-beef.png, cloves.jpg, ribs.png, 23236, ribs, ribs, ribs.png, 1022030, 2004, 11215, 23236, peppercorns, bay leaves, garlic, ribs, peppercorns, bay leaves, garlic, ribs, black-pepper.png, bay-leaves.jpg, garlic.png, ribs.png, 14412, 23236, water, ribs, water, ribs, water.png, ribs.png, 11583, 11109, 0, 23236, vegetable, cabbage, glaze, ribs, vegetable, cabbage, glaze, ribs, mixed-vegetables.png, cabbage.jpg, , ribs.png, 2053, 19335, 14003, vinegar, sugar, beer, vinegar, sugar, beer, vinegar-(white).jpg, sugar-in-bowl.png, beer.jpg, 11583, 2046, 0, 23236, vegetable, mustard, glaze, ribs, vegetable, mustard, glaze, ribs, mixed-vegetables.png, regular-mustard.jpg, , ribs.png, 11583, 23236, vegetable, ribs, vegetable, ribs, mixed-vegetables.png, ribs.png, 11583, 0, 23236, vegetable, glaze, ribs, vegetable, glaze, ribs, mixed-vegetables.png, , ribs.png, 0, 23236, glaze, ribs, glaze, ribs, , ribs.png, 0, 0, 23236, glaze, base, ribs, glaze, base, ribs, , , ribs.png, 0, 19335, 23236, glaze, sugar, ribs, glaze, sugar, ribs, , sugar-in-bowl.png, ribs.png, 11583, 1065062, 23236, vegetable, meat, ribs, vegetable, meat, ribs, mixed-vegetables.png, whole-chicken.jpg, ribs.png, 404784, oven, oven, oven.jpg, 404629, 404667, roasting pan, dutch oven, roasting pan, dutch oven, roasting-pan.jpg, dutch-oven.jpg, 404645, frying pan, frying pan, pan.png, 404784, 404645, oven, frying pan, oven, frying pan, oven.jpg, pan.png, 404669, sauce pan, sauce pan, sauce-pan.jpg, 404784, oven, oven, oven.jpg, 404645, frying pan, frying pan, pan.png, 404784, oven, oven, oven.jpg, 404784, oven, oven, oven.jpg, NA, NA, NA, NA, 270, 5, NA, 120, NA, NA, 30, 10, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, minutes, minutes, NA, minutes, NA, NA, minutes, minutes, NA

## `diet.restrictions`

For people with dietary restrictions, intolerances, or sensitivities,
this function allows you to specify
[diet](https://spoonacular.com/food-api/docs#Diets) and food
[intolerances](https://spoonacular.com/food-api/docs#Intolerances). It
also allows for ingredients to be excluded or included. To give more
than one option for a given input, you will need to give a string of
comma separated values.

``` r
#function to search for recipes given diet type, food intolerances, excluded ingredients
diet.restrictions <- function(apiKey=NULL, query=NULL, diet=NULL, intolerances=NULL, exclude=NULL, include=NULL){
  #require API key
  if(is.null(apiKey)){
    return("Please enter your API key.")
  }
  
  input <- list(apiKey=apiKey, query=query, diet=diet, intolerances=intolerances, excludeIngredients=exclude, includeIngredients=include, NULL)
  opts <- input[-which(sapply(input, is.null))]
  #remove spaces from user input
  for(i in 1:length(opts)){
    opts[i]<-str_remove_all(opts[i], " ")
  }
  #create URL
  link <- "https://api.spoonacular.com/recipes/complexSearch?"
  for(i in 1:length(opts)){
    link<-paste0(link,"&", names(opts[i]), "=", opts[i])
  }
  link <- str_remove(link, "&")    #remove the first &
  dat <- httr::GET(link)
  df<- jsonlite::fromJSON(dat$url)
  results <- as.data.frame(df)
  return(results)
}
```

An example of this function is shown here:

``` r

# Data Exploration

### Compare two different diets’ chicken recipes: Ketogenic vs. Whole 30

The descriptions of the diets are as follows:  
\* **Ketogenic**: The keto diet is based more on the ratio of fat,
protein, and carbs in the diet rather than specific ingredients.
Generally speaking, high fat, protein-rich foods are acceptable and high
carbohydrate foods are not. The formula we use is 55-80% fat content,
15-35% protein content, and under 10% of carbohydrates.  
\* **Whole30**: Allowed ingredients include meat, fish/seafood, eggs,
vegetables, fresh fruit, coconut oil, olive oil, small amounts of dried
fruit and nuts/seeds. Ingredients not allowed include added sweeteners
(natural and artificial, except small amounts of fruit juice), dairy
(except clarified butter or ghee), alcohol, grains, legumes (except
green beans, sugar snap peas, and snow peas), and food additives, such
as carrageenan, MSG, and sulfites.

#### Create two new columns:

-   PC.ratio: Represents Protein to Carbohydrates ratio in each recipe  
-   Protein.level: Diet is rich in protein if PC.ratio \>= 4, or
    balanced if PC.ratio \< 4.

``` r
nutri$Protein<- as.numeric(nutri$Protein)
nutri$Carbohydrates<-as.numeric(nutri$Carbohydrates)
nutri_new<-nutri %>% mutate(PC.ratio=(Protein/Carbohydrates)) %>% mutate(Protein.content = if_else(PC.ratio>=4, "rich", "balanced"))
nutri_new
```

#### Create a summary of how many protein rich recipes in “keto” and “whole 30” groups repectively:

``` r
table(nutri_new$Diet, nutri_new$Protein.content)
```

    ##        
    ##         balanced rich
    ##   keto         7    3
    ##   whole        5    5

As shown in the table above, there are a few more protein rich diets in
the “whole 30” group. However, the protein content does not seem to
differ much between the two groups.

#### Some summaries about carbohydrates amount (in grams) in different subgroups of the nutrients data set.

``` r
nutri_new %>% group_by (Diet) %>% summarize(mean_car=mean(Carbohydrates), SD_car=sd(Carbohydrates))
```

    ## # A tibble: 2 × 3
    ##   Diet  mean_car SD_car
    ##   <chr>    <dbl>  <dbl>
    ## 1 keto      10.9   4.47
    ## 2 whole     16.9  20.1

Based on the summary table above, the mean of carbohydrates (in grams)
is higher in “whole 30” diet than the “keto” diet. However, the data
varies a lot in “whole 30” groups due to a larger standard deviation.

``` r
nutri_new %>% group_by (Diet) %>% summarize(mean_pro=mean(Protein), SD_pro=sd(Protein))
```

    ## # A tibble: 2 × 3
    ##   Diet  mean_pro SD_pro
    ##   <chr>    <dbl>  <dbl>
    ## 1 keto      34.4   12.1
    ## 2 whole     30.8   12.8

Based on the summary table above, the mean and standard deviation of
protein (in grams) does not differ much between the “whole 30” diet and
“keto” diet.

#### Plots about carbohydrates and Protein content in different subgroups of the nutrients data set.

##### Bar plot of protein level (rich and balanced) in “keto” and “whole 30” groups

``` r
ggplot(data=nutri_new, aes(x=Diet)) +
  geom_bar(aes(fill=Protein.content), position = "dodge") +
  labs(x="Protein content", title="Bar Plot of Protein content")
```

![](README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png)<!-- -->

We would like to compare if the protein content (rich or balanced) are
same among two diet groups. Based on the plot, “keto” diet has more
balanced protein content in the recipe than “whole30” groups. However,
we only have 10 recipes in each groups. More samples might be needed if
we want to know which diet is more healthier.

##### Histogram of carbohydrates amount (in grams) in two diet groups

``` r
ggplot(nutri_new)+
  geom_histogram(aes(x=Carbohydrates, fill=Diet), colour="black", alpha=0.4, position = "identity") +
  labs(x = "carbohydrates amount in grams", title = "Histogram of carbohydrates amount in two diet groups")
```

    ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.

![](README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png)<!-- -->

This histogram is for the continuous variable “carbohydrates” in our
dataset. We would like to how the amount of carbohydrates are
distributed among two diet groups. It looks like most recipes have low
carbohydrates in both diet groups, mostly around 10 grams. However,
there is one recipe in “whole30” group with high carbohydrates.

##### Box plot of protein amount (in grams) in two diet groups

``` r
ggplot(nutri_new, aes(x=Diet, y=Protein)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill="grey") +
  labs(title="Box plot of protein amount in two diet groups")
```

![](README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-18-1.png)<!-- -->

This box plot is comparing protein content among two diet groups. The
median value of protein is higher in “keto” groups than “whole30”
groups. The interquartile range (IQR) is wider for “whole30” group than
“keto” group , which indicates more data variability in “whole30” group.

##### Scatter plot of Protein/carbohydrates amount in each recipe of two diet groups

``` r
ggplot(nutri_new, aes(x=Carbohydrates, y=Protein, color=Diet, shape=Diet)) +
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  labs(title="Scatter plot of Protein and Carbohydrates amount in two diet groups ")
```

![](README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-19-1.png)<!-- -->

This scatter plot is comparing Protein/Carbohydrates content in each
recipe of the two groups. When the Protein/carbohydrates ratio gets too
large, it might harm our body since the Protein is too high. We can
easily visualize the slope of the points for each diet group, so that we
will know which diet might have a higher Protein to Carbohydrates ratio.

### Looking at randomly generated recipes

Using our `random.recipes` function, we can specify how many recipes we
want, and we can see how many fall into specific types. For example, how
many of our recipes are vegetarian only, dairy free only, both, or
neither.

``` r
rand <- random.recipes(apiKey = "31bf40952ec14026b2f82b5055fdab93", number=50)
table(Vegetarian=rand$recipes.vegetarian, DairyFree=rand$recipes.dairyFree)
```

    ##           DairyFree
    ## Vegetarian FALSE TRUE
    ##      FALSE    19   15
    ##      TRUE     12    4

We might also see the number of servings these recipes yield.

If following a Weight Watchers diet, we might even look at the number of
SmartPoints.

Or, we might group by the total time.
